# Read the two parts of the question below:
# Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”.
# If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever.

# Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time.
# Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question whether they want to continue guessing.
# The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”.
# (The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed the correct number)
