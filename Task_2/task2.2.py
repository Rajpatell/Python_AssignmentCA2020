# Write a program in Python to perform the following operator based task:
# Ask user to choose the following option first:
    # If User Enter 1 - Addition
    # If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
    # If User Enter 3 - Division
    # If USer Enter 4 - Multiplication
    # If User Enter 5 - Average
# Ask user to enter the 2 numbers in a variable for first and second for the first 4 options mentioned above.
# Ask user to enter two more numbers as first1 and second2 for calculating the average as soon as the user chooses an option 5.
# At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “NEGATIVE”

# NOTE: At a time user can perform one action at a time.
